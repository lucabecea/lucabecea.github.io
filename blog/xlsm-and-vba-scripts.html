# XLSM and VBA scripts

Adding dropdowns to an excell sheet with the free version of SheetJs.

Among the paid features of SheetJs is the option to add dropdowns and more formulas.
Unfortunately this is not avaialble on all projects, due to business and financial contraints, so we have to resort to using workarounds. 
I couldn't find anything about this solution, so hopefully someone will find this short entry useful and won't waste as much time as I did searching for it.

The requierment was to add dropdowns to an excell file without using SheetJs paid options. 
We also had to coorelated the selected values to some IDs and numbers which could have been coded in the app if we couldn't come up with any solution,
but if we changes the name of a question, we would have to redo all the selection, despite the IDs not changing. 
It is ideal to have this part as an excel formula too

VBA scripts do offer the option to create dropdowns programatically 
(the internet is filled with easy to find [examples](https://basicexceltutorial.com/excel-vba-code-for-drop-down-list/)), 
and fortunately we can also add formulas to a lot of cells using the same solution without having to use SheetJs ([example]()).
However, the other problem is that SheetJs can't edit VBA scripts in it's free version, so we are back to the square one: we have a need that is unmet.
Thankfully, deep in the docs, it is stated that we can [copy it](https://docs.sheetjs.com/docs/csf/features/vba/) from another file.
The rest is easy peasy, have fun.

## example (in progress):

Donor file: [sheetjs-and-vba.xlsm](../assets/sheetjs-and-vba.xlsm)

<script lang="javascript" crossorigin="anonymous" src="https://cdn.sheetjs.com/xlsx-0.20.3/package/dist/xlsx.full.min.js"></script>
<script type="module">
    document.getElementById('generateExcel').onclick = function () {
        console.warn('generating')
        // read the xlsm file
        var workbook = XLSX.read('../assets/sheetjs-and-vba.xlsm', { bookVBA: true });
        // extract vba script
        var encoded_vba_blob = workbook.vbaraw
        
        // // create a new worsheet and workbook
        var worksheet = XLSX.utils.aoa_to_sheet([[]])
        var newWorkbook = XLSX.utils.book_new(worksheet)
        // // add the vba script
        newWorkbook.vbaraw = encoded_vba_blob;
        // // write the file
        var file = XLSX.writeFile(newWorkbook, "excel-with-vba-script.xlsm");
